    <li>Add the finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.</li>
    <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the oil separates.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture has cooled down, add it to the marinated Maggi noodles and curd. Mix everything well to combine the flavors.</li>
    <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>You can also serve curd Maggi with a wedge of lemon for some extra tangy flavor (optional).</li>
